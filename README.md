I had gotten this weird error again where I load the site and it keeps refreshing and freaking out. Anyways it seems to be fixed by clicking an anchor a lot and I also found this. I will link it in case something messes up afterwards. 
"DevTools failed to load source map: Could not parse content for MYSITE Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0 "

## Explain Site
Well, I tried getting it as close as I could to the original, unfortunately some things weren't perfect such as the pop up when you go to sign in, and the footer is a bit clunky, etc. As far as the design I feel like I got it down for the most part, my struggles are once again with the JS/JQUERY, back end firebase stuff. I will work on it over break and see if I get better. But for now, I am turning this in. I attempted to target certain buttons, and tried adding a counter for the cart, which unfortunately suffers the most from a lack of content. I also had more weird issues deploying it but it seems to be fine now.
